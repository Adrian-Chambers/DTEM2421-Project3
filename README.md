# DTEM2421-Project3

A basic website created as a final project for my "Digital Production for New Media" class (DTEM 2421) with instructor Hamidreza Nassiri. The prompt required me to use my knowledge of HTML & CSS to design and build a basic personal website with the following pages: 
  - Home Page
  - Projects
  - About Me
  - Contact


## Home

The prompt for the "home" page is shown below.
> On the Home page, the user should be able to find:
>  - A general description of you and your website
>  - A well-structured menu linking to the other pages on your website
  
I wrote a simple description about myself and the website. The image on this page is from Adobe Stock.

  
## About Me

The prompt for the "about me" page is shown below.
> On the About Me page, you should provide:
>  - A brief bio
>  - A photo of yours (optional but encouraged)
>  - Your achievements (as a list)
>  - Your skills (as a list)
>  - A well-structured menu linking to the other pages on your website

I wrote a bio about myself next to an image of myself. I also created unordered lists for my achievements and skills. The other images on this page are from Adobe Stock.


## Projects

The prompt for the "projects" page is shown below.
> On the Projects page, the user should be able to find:
>  - Your first project’s images (a total of 8), properly structured and captioned along with a brief description of what they are and what you did
>  - Your second project’s final cut (as a video upload or as an embedded Youtube/Vimeo video) along with a brief description of what it is and what you did
>  - A well-structured menu linking to the other pages on your website

I made sections to describe and showcase both of my projects in the class. 


### Project #1: Reimagining Our Shared Spaces

I was prompted to take photographs of public spaces in NYC and on campus, then "recreate" the spaces by editing them in Adobe Photoshop. I took photographs of Keating Hall at Fordham University's Rosehill campus and a picnic space in Manhattan at 30W 61st, close to Fordham's Lincoln Center campus. 

On the webpage, I wrote a description of the project and my process. I included both the unedited and edited images along with image captions.


### Project #2: Short Documentary

I was prompted to create "a short documentary about an event, organization, or community in NYC". I had to film the video and edit it using Adobe Premiere Pro.

I filmed at an event called "Queer Memoir: Drag Story Hour Changed My Life", which took place at Caveat in Manhattan on March 13, 2022. I reached out to both organizations (Drag Story Hour NYC and Queer Memoir) prior to the event to get permission to film. Other clips shown in the video were provided by the organization or were available for public use online.

On the webpage, I wrote a description about the event and my process. I uploaded the video to Youtube and embedded it in the page.


## Contact

The prompt for the "contact" page is shown below.
> On the Contact page, you should provide:
>  - A link to your email that would open a Mail application
>  - A well-structured menu linking to the other pages on your website
  
I included links to my email address, LinkedIn, and Github. The image on this page is from Adobe Stock, and the icons are from flaticon.
