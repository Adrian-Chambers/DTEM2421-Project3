                <p>
                    I am a computer science student from Fordham university, currently in my senior year. 
                    I graduated from Suffolk County Community College with an associate's degree in 2020 and I am currently working towards my bachelor's degree. 
                    I am hoping to become a successful software developer in the near future.
                    I have a passion for programming, music, and cats!
