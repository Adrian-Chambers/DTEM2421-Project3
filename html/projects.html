            <p>
                For this project, I was given the prompt to take photographs of public shared spaces in NYC and on campus, then "reimagine" the spaces by editing them using photoshop. For each space I took 2 photographs, one using a wide lens and one using a telefoto lens.
                <br /><br />
                I took pictures of the lawn outside of Fordham University's Keating Hall building and a picnic space in Manhattan at 30W 61st. These pictures were taken in February 2022, after it had snowed the day prior.
                <br /><br />
                This is my first time using photoshop to edit photos taken in real life! Prior to this, I have only used photoshop to create graphics and mock-ups for websites. This is also my first time using a professional camera to take photos.

                <span class="red-text">Project 2: </span>
                <span class="white-text">Short Documentary</span>
            </h1>
            <p>For this project, I had to "make a short documentary about an event, organization, or community in NYC". I filmed <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/queer-memoir-drag-story-hour-saved-my-life-tickets-264680846537">an event called "Queer Memoir: Drag Story Hour Changed My Life"</a>, which took place at Caveat in Manhattan on March 13, 2022. At this event, we hear stories about how an organization known as "Drag Story Hour NYC" has impacted the lives of everyday New Yorkers, including parents, children, teachers, librarians, drag artists, and members of the local LGBT+ community. 
                <br /><br />
                I learned about Drag Story Hour through a friend of mine, who works as a librarian at the kids/teens section of a NY public library. I was curious to learn more about the organization, and it just so happen that they announced this event at around the same time that I was given the prompt for my class project. With the recent nation-wide surge in discourse and legislature regarding the discussion of gender, sexuality, and other lgbt+ topics in schools and educational settings (such as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill in Florida), I thought it would be interesting and informative to show how addressing these topics in a fun and age-appropriate way has been beneficial to NYC communities, and can be beneficial to other communities as well.
                <br /><br />
                Thank you to <a href="https://queermemoir.com/">Queer Memoir</a> and <a href="https://www.dshnyc.org/">Drag Story Hour NYC</a> for allowing me to film at their event, and thank you so much to all the speakers for sharing their stories!
