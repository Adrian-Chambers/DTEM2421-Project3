        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, I was given the prompt to first take photographs of spaces in NYC and on campus, then edit them using photoshop. For each area, I had to take photographs using a wide lens and a telefoto lens.
            <br /><br />
            This is my first time using photoshop to edit photos taken in real life! Prior to this, I have only used photoshop to create graphics and mock-ups of websites. This is also my first time using a professional camera to take photos.

        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <p>For this project, I had to "make a short documentary about an event, organization, or community in NYC". I filmed an event called "Queer Memoir: Drag Story Hour Changed My Life", which took place at Caveat in Manhattan on March 13, 2022. At this event, we hear stories about how an organization known as "Drag Story Hour NYC" has impacted the lives of everyday New Yorkers, including parents, children, teachers, librarians, drag artists, and members of the local LGBT+ community. 
            <br /><br />
            I learned about Drag Story Hour through a friend of mine, who works as a librarian at the kids/teens section of a NY public library. I was curious to learn more about the organization, and it just so happen that they announced this event at around the same time that I was given the prompt for my class project. With the recent nation-wide surge in discourse and legislature regarding the discussion of gender, sexuality, and other lgbt+ topics in schools and educational settings (such as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill in Florida), I thought it would be interesting and informative to show how addressing these topics in a fun and age-appropriate way has been beneficial to NYC communities, and can be beneficial to other communities as well.
            <br /><br />
            Thank you to Queer Memoir and Drag Story Hour NYC for allowing me to film at their event, and thank you so much to all the speakers for sharing their stories!
